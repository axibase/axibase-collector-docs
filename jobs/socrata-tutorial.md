# Socrata Job Tutorial

This tutorial walks through setting up a Socrata job in Collector for a `data.gov` dataset on [New York City Social Media Usage](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-social-media-usage-555a2).
The JSON file (1.1 MB) can be found on the [City of New York website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/5b3a-rs48/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD).

1. Log in to Collector.

2. Open the **Jobs** tab in Collector.

3. Click **Add Job**.

4. To select the type of job you want to add, complete either of these steps.

   * Before completing the previous step, filter by target job type (Socrata) in the **Jobs** tab. After clicking **Add Job**, job type is specified.

   * Click **Add Job** (step 3). On the following page, select your specified job type.

5. As shown in the image below, there are four fields to specify: **Enabled**, **Name**, **`cron` Expression**, and **Storage**.

   * **Enabled**: job status. Enable the job, and schedule the job for data collection with the period specified in the **`cron` Expression**, by clicking the checkbox. To
      have the job disabled, do not click the checkbox. Leave disabled for this tutorial.
   * **Name**: job name. Enter in a relevant name for your new Socrata job. For this tutorial, use the name `NYC-Social-Media-Usage`.
   * **`cron` Expression**: job execution time period. `cron` fields are specified in the following order: second, minute, hour, day-of-month, month, and day-of-week. You can randomize time of execution by putting `R` onto time placeholders. Click
      the field to see time periods in human-readable formats, as shown in the image below.
   * **Storage**: database for storing data collected by this job.

7. Click **Create Configuration**.

8. Copy the short URL (without `rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD` selected) from your JSON file and paste the URL into the `Path` line. User does not need to fill in the **Name** field, as
   the field is automatically filled in from the previous page. For more information on the remaining fields in this screenshot, see [Job Configuration Documentation](../jobs/socrata.md#job-configuration).

9. Press **Add** to create a preconfigured settings section.
10. Press **Test**. To view descriptions of each of the fields shown below, see [Job Configuration Documentation](../jobs/socrata.md#job-configuration).

11. After clicking **Test**, you must get the following output: Collector downloads a part of the JSON file (file limitation 1 MB) and generates commands based on
    the dataset configuration (series, property, message, metric, and entity tags). These commands are only for text purposes, and are not yet saved in ATSD.

    Save this configuration by clicking **Save**, shown in the image from step 10.

12. Go back to the Socrata job (the figure shown in step 7). Click **Run**. This sends generated commands to ATSD, which enables user to begin working with this dataset.
    After hitting **Run**, you are redirected to this page by the database. Hit **Refresh** after a couple of seconds. If the database successfully completed the job, you see something like the images below.

    ![Figure 13](./images/Figure13.png)

13. Log in to your local ATSD instance. Open the **Entities** tab to verify that metrics from the dataset are present in ATSD. You can search by your `dataset id`, which
    is assigned by the database from the original JSON file, in this case the id is `5b3a-rs48`. You can see that metrics are successfully sent from Collector to ATSD and begin analyzing this dataset.
